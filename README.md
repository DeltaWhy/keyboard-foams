# Keyboard Foams
Files for laser cutting foam for various keyboards. A little terminology:

- **Plate foam** goes between the plate and PCB, and has square/rectangular cutouts for the switches. Only used for MX switches as there's not enough space for it with low-profile switches (the plate sits flush or nearly flush against the PCB).
- **PCB foam** goes under the PCB, between the PCB and the bottom case.
