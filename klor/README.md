# KLOR
This PCB foam is for the KS-27 version of the KLOR, original by GEIST and modified by sadekbaroudi. This file is for the Konrad layout. If you're using the haptic driver you'll need to cut out a little section around it by hand.

I think this will fit the normal KLOR as well but I haven't tested it.
