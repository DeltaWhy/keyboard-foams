# KLOR
This PCB foam is for the KS-27 version of the KLOR, original by GEIST and modified by sadekbaroudi. This file is for the Konrad layout. If you're using the haptic driver you'll need to cut out a little section around it by hand. Use the modified bottom plate `konrad-bottom-plate-right-3.4mm-lip.stl`.

I think this will fit the normal KLOR as well (though you'll probably need to modify the case) but I haven't tested it.
